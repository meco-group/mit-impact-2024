description: Workshop on optimal control problems and model predictive control. July 10th - 11th @ Cambridge, MA
---

### Overview

Workshop on nonlinear optimal control and model predictive control using CasADi, Rockit and Impact.

This workshop is organized by members of the [MECO Research Team](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/meco) of KU Leuven, Belgium. The MECO Research Team focusses on modeling, estimation, identification, analysis and optimal control of motion and motion systems such as mechatronic systems or machine tools. It combines theoretical contributions (development of design methodologies) with experimental knowhow (implementation and experimental validation on lab-scale as well as industrial setups). The theoretical research benefits from the group's expertise on numerical optimization, especially convex optimization. 

This workshop has received funding from the *MIT-Belgium - KU Leuven Seed Fund* within the framework of the *MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI)* grant programme.
